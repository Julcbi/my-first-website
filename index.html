        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a Software Engineering student based in Germany, currently exploring my passion for frontend development.</p>
        <p>Although I started my journey by learning backend, I discovered that I enjoy frontend much more because I love working on user interfaces and app design.</p>
