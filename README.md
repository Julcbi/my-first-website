# My First Website - About Julia Bindi

This is a simple personal web page created as part of my learning journey in frontend development.

## About Me

I am a Software Engineering student based in Germany, currently focusing on improving my frontend skills.  
Although I started learning backend, I found frontend more exciting because I enjoy designing and building user interfaces.

At the moment, I am working on a university project where we are developing a connected Stock Market App and Website.  
This project involves both design and functionality, allowing me to apply my skills in a real product experience.

## What I Learned

- Basic HTML structure
- Semantic tags (headings, paragraphs, lists, links, etc.)
- How to add images and links
- Styling the page using background colors and text alignment
